# Line_Codes_Mean-ACF_Investigation
The project purpose is to generate an ensemble that consists of 500 waveforms (Realizations), each
containing 100 bits, for the 3 different line codes mentioned below:
- Unipolar NRZ
- Polar NRZ
- Polar RZ
### It is required for each line code to compute:
1. The statistical mean.
2. Is the random process stationary?
3. Determine the ensemble autocorrelation function Rx(Ï„).
4. The time mean and autocorrelation function for one waveform.
5. Is the random process Ergodic?
6. What is the bandwidth of the transmitted signal.
